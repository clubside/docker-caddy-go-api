![Docker, Caddy and Go Wrapped up in a Bow](img/docker-caddy-go-header.webp)
# Windows, Docker, Caddy and localhost
This tutorial will walk you through a number of tasks to realize this development environment:
1. Create a Go-based Application Programming Interface with multiple routes
2. Add support for static content including a Single Page App
3. Create an SPA that accesses the API to grab web pages and display an OpenGraph-based link if available
4. Switch to Caddy Server to handle static content
5. Use a `Caddyfile` to reverse proxy the API and support SPA internal routing
6. Put both Go and Caddy into a Docker container
7. Add Air for automatic updating of the Go API while the container is active
8. Expose the Caddy Admin API to the Docker Host to add HTTPS

I began this journey with Joe Purdy's [My Go development environment with HTTPS and Dynamic Reloading](https://www.purdy.dev/words/basic-go-development-environment-with-https-and-dynamic-reloading/) but I ran into some issues mostly tied to differences in host (Windows vs. Linux) and scope (SPA vs. simple API).

## Step 1: Go-based Application Programming Interface
This is very much a barebones sample as the ultimate goal of this project is to document the steps necessary to do local web development in a secure container but you have to start somewhere. That brings us here and our first two files:

go.mod
```
module spa

go 1.19
```

main.go
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"net/http"
	"strconv"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/api/v1/key", serviceKey)
	http.HandleFunc("/api/v1/og", serviceOpenGraph)

	fmt.Println("SPA API Server")
	fmt.Printf("Starting API on %s\n", time.Now().Format("Jan 02, 2006 15:04 MST"))
	log.Fatalln(http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil))
}

func serviceKey(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	paramLength := r.URL.Query().Get("length")
	if paramLength == "" {
		w.Write([]byte("no length parameter provided"))
		return
	}

	length, err := strconv.Atoi(paramLength)
	if err != nil {
		w.Write([]byte("invalid length parameter: " + paramLength))
		return
	}

	digits := "0123456789"
	specials := "~=+%^*!@#$"
	all := "ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ" +
		"abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" +
		digits + specials
	buf := make([]byte, length)
	buf[0] = digits[rand.Intn(len(digits))]
	buf[1] = specials[rand.Intn(len(specials))]
	for i := 2; i < length; i++ {
		buf[i] = all[rand.Intn(len(all))]
	}
	rand.Shuffle(len(buf), func(i, j int) {
		buf[i], buf[j] = buf[j], buf[i]
	})

	w.Write(buf)
}

func serviceOpenGraph(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
	paramURL := r.URL.Query().Get("url")
	if paramURL == "" {
		w.Write([]byte("no url parameter provided"))
		return
	}

	req, err := http.NewRequest("GET", paramURL, nil)
	if err != nil {
		errString := "url get error: " + err.Error()
		w.Write([]byte(errString))
		return
	}

	cli := http.Client{}
	res, err := cli.Do(req)
	if err != nil {
		errString := "http client error: " + err.Error()
		w.Write([]byte(errString))
		return
	}

	if res.StatusCode < 200 || res.StatusCode > 299 {
		errString := "http status error: " + res.Status
		w.Write([]byte(errString))
		return
	}

	body, err := io.ReadAll(res.Body)
	res.Body.Close()
	if err != nil {
		errString := "http body error: " + err.Error()
		w.Write([]byte(errString))
		return
	}

	w.Write([]byte(body))
}
```
We now have a server listening on port 3000 for two API routes, `/api/v1/key` and `/api/v1/og`. "Key"  returns a random string of the `length` specified in that parameter, and "OG" returns the contents of a URI specified in the `url` parameter. To test this first step enter `go run main.go` then in your browser try `http://localhost:3000/api/v1/key?length=25` to see things working. What happens when you try the "url" route? ðŸ˜›

## Step 2: Go Server for Static Files and SPA
The title of this piece says Caddy will be serving our full website but for the moment we're going to temporarily use our API server to also serve static files and the SPA that will complete our development sandbox. Our API doesn't change but the top of `main.go` gets expanded:
```
package main

import (
	"fmt"
	"io"
	"io/fs"
	"log"
	"math/rand"
	"net/http"
	"os"
	"strconv"
	"strings"
	"time"
)

func main() {
	http.HandleFunc("/api/v1/key", serviceKey)
	http.HandleFunc("/api/v1/og", serviceOpenGraph)

	var frontend fs.FS = os.DirFS("public")
	httpFS := http.FS(frontend)
	fileServer := http.FileServer(httpFS)
	serveIndex := serveFileContents("index.html", httpFS)

	http.Handle("/", intercept404(fileServer, serveIndex))

	fmt.Println("SPA API Server")
	fmt.Printf("Starting API on %s\n", time.Now().Format("Jan 02, 2006 15:04 MST"))
	log.Fatalln(http.ListenAndServe(":3000", nil))
}

func intercept404(handler, on404 http.Handler) http.Handler {
	return http.HandlerFunc(func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		hookedWriter := &hookedResponseWriter{ResponseWriter: w}
		handler.ServeHTTP(hookedWriter, r)

		if hookedWriter.got404 {
			on404.ServeHTTP(w, r)
		}
	})
}

type hookedResponseWriter struct {
	http.ResponseWriter
	got404 bool
}

func (hrw *hookedResponseWriter) WriteHeader(status int) {
	if status == http.StatusNotFound {
		// Don't actually write the 404 header, just set a flag.
		hrw.got404 = true
	} else {
		hrw.ResponseWriter.WriteHeader(status)
	}
}

func (hrw *hookedResponseWriter) Write(p []byte) (int, error) {
	if hrw.got404 {
		// No-op, but pretend that we wrote len(p) bytes to the writer.
		return len(p), nil
	}

	return hrw.ResponseWriter.Write(p)
}

func serveFileContents(file string, files http.FileSystem) http.HandlerFunc {
	return func(w http.ResponseWriter, r *http.Request) {
		// Restrict only to instances where the browser is looking for an HTML file
		if !strings.Contains(r.Header.Get("Accept"), "text/html") {
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
			fmt.Fprint(w, "404 not found")

			return
		}

		// Open the file and return its contents using http.ServeContent
		index, err := files.Open(file)
		if err != nil {
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
			fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s not found", file)

			return
		}

		fi, err := index.Stat()
		if err != nil {
			w.WriteHeader(http.StatusNotFound)
			fmt.Fprintf(w, "%s not found", file)

			return
		}

		w.Header().Set("Content-Type", "text/html; charset=utf-8")
		http.ServeContent(w, r, fi.Name(), fi.ModTime(), index)
	}
}
```
In order to add support for serving static files and a Single Page Application we nned to focus on this block of Go code:
```
	var frontend fs.FS = os.DirFS("public")
	httpFS := http.FS(frontend)
	fileServer := http.FileServer(httpFS)
	serveIndex := serveFileContents("index.html", httpFS)

	http.Handle("/", intercept404(fileServer, serveIndex))
```
It's here that we hook into the file system for our static folder root, `public`, and SPA file `index.html`. Go's built-in `FileServer` will handle all non-`html` files while `intercept404` will ensure local navigation will always be sent to `index.html`.

Please check out Trevor Taubitz's [Serving Single-Page Apps From Go](https://hackandsla.sh/posts/2021-11-06-serve-spa-from-go/) if you're interested in more about how this functionality is being handled. Our Go server is now ready to serve both our API and static files, so it's time to add those components to our project.

## Step 3: Single Page Application and Static Files

The SPA, a simple `index.html`, is one of a few basic files that will make up our static site. In addition to [The New CSS Reset](https://github.com/elad2412/the-new-css-reset) we will have our own CSS, JavaScript and an image to test our updated Go server. All of these files are placed in the folder `public` at the root of our project.

What else goes in the root? A few `favicon` permutations of course, and we're not skimping here. Starting with Andrey Sitnik's [How to Favicon in 2023: Six files that fit most needs](https://evilmartians.com/chronicles/how-to-favicon-in-2021-six-files-that-fit-most-needs) and a generic SVG logo head over to Philippe Bernard's [RealFaviconGenerator](https://realfavicongenerator.net/) to generate more than what we need.

With these ecoutraments out of the way let's look at what is going on with our SPA.

## Step 4: Switch to Caddy to handle static files
Here we use Caddy locally along with our GO API server. Nothing changes functionality-wise but we get a rock-solid web server for our project thanks to a single download and file. Head over to the [Caddy Download Page](https://caddyserver.com/download) and grab the right version for your operating system the create a `Caddyfile` which serves as the configuration:
```
{
	http_port 2010
	servers :2015 {
		listener_wrappers {
			http_redirect
			tls
		}
	}
}
https://localhost:2015 {
	encode zstd gzip

	handle /api/* {
		reverse_proxy localhost:3000
	}

	handle {
		root * public
		try_files {path} index.html
		file_server
	}
}
```
All we care about is HTTPS which Caddy will handle for us automatically. If you're not already running a web server this configuration would be much simpler but let's go with custom ports to avoid conflicts. The first section is for globals. The `http_port` is necessary because we're not using the conventional `80` and `443` and we're always forcing HTTPS but Caddy needs some port defined. The `servers :2015` block tells Caddy to forward all traffic to HTTPS and ensure there is an SSL certificate. The second section defines the behavior of our server, in this case adding compression to files, redirecting all calls to `/api/` to our Go server, and finally replacing what we had added to the Go server for static files and the SPA.

Now comes the tricky part which will only matter for this step: running two executables. If you're in Visual Studio Code it's easy enough to open multiple terminals but however you want to do it you need to run both `go run main.go` and 'caddy run`. If you have never used Caddy before you'll be prompted to save the certificate needed for HTTPS. On Windows you'll see something like this:

![Caddy HTTPS Certificate Dialog on Windows](img/caddy-run-certificate.webp)

After the certificate is good you can now browse the site at `https://localhost:2015`. We're back to the same functionality we had in Step 3, but with two servers that we're about to wrap up inside a container.
