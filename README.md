# docker-caddy-go-api
Containerized development environment with static HTTPS and Go-based API

A full tutorial on the development of this project can be found in the `docs` folder or live here:

https://clubside.github.io/docker-caddy-go-api/

A full tutorial on the concepts and technologies used in this project is the ultimate goal. The documentation will continue to get updates and revision notes will be added here. If changes to the final files here in the root or within `public` become necessary a new release will be generated.
